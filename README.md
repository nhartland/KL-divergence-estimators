# KL divergence estimators

Here I test a few implementations of a KL-divergence estimator
based on k-Nearest-Neighbours probability density estimation.

The estimator is that of 

> Qing Wang, Sanjeev R. Kulkarni, and Sergio VerdÃº. "Divergence estimation for multidimensional densities via k-nearest-neighbor distances." Information Theory, IEEE Transactions on 55.5 (2009): 2392-2405.

Samples are drawn from various test distributions, and the estimated
KL-divergence between them is computed. Where given, uncertainties are
assessed by re-sampling the distributions and re-computing divergence estimates
`n_resamples=100` times. Uncertainty bands are then given as the interval
containing 68% of the re-sampled estimates closest to the median.

This study is far from exhaustive, and timings are sensitive to implementation
details. Please take with a pinch of salt.


# Estimator implementations


 - **naive_estimator**

    KL-Divergence estimator using brute-force (numpy) k-NN

 - **scipy_estimator**

    KL-Divergence estimator using scipy's KDTree

 - **skl_estimator**

    KL-Divergence estimator using scikit-learn's NearestNeighbours


These estimators have been benchmarked against `slaypni/universal-divergence`.

## 1-D self-divergence
 Estimate the divergence between two samples of size **N** and dimension
    1, drawn from the same ~ N(0,1) probability distribution.

## 2-D self-divergence
 Estimate the divergence between two samples of size **N** drawn
    from the same 2D distribution with
    `mean=[0,0]` and `covariance=[[1, 0.1], [0.1, 1]]`.

Which will then likely take some time to complete.

#### Requirements

- Python >= 3.6
- scipy, scikit-learn, jinja2 

#### Important settings

The number of resamples used to estimate uncertainties is defined by
`n_resamples` in `tests.py`. This is naturally an *extremely* sensitive variable
for how long the tests take to run.
